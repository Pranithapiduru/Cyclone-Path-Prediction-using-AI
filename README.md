 Title: Cyclone-Path-Prediction-using-AI

 Problem Statement :
Cyclones are highly unpredictable in terms of their paths and intensities. Current forecasting methods are often slow and sometimes inaccurate at local levels. There is a pressing need for a more efficient and intelligent system that can learn from historical patterns and provide faster, more accurate predictions to support disaster management efforts.

 Description :
 This project aims to predict the path of tropical cyclones using AI techniques.In Week 1, we focus on dataset exploration and understanding. The dataset contains historical cyclone track data (wind speed, pressure, latitude, longitude, etc.).

Dataset Description:
The dataset includes historical cyclone track information:
- Date and Time of observation
- Latitude and Longitude (geographical coordinates)
- Maximum Sustained Wind Speed (knots)
- Central Pressure (hPa)
- Sea Surface Temperature (optional for better predictions)

 Methodology:
1. Data Collection: Gather cyclone track datasets from IMD, NOAA, or Kaggle.
2. Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, normalize features, and structure time-series sequences.
3. Model Development: Build an LSTM/RNN model using TensorFlow/Keras to capture temporal dependencies.
4. Training & Testing: Train the model on 80% of data and validate on 20%.
5. Evaluation: Use RMSE and other metrics to compare predictions with actual cyclone tracks.
6. Visualization: Plot cyclone tracks on interactive maps using Folium or Plotly.
7. Deployment (Optional): Develop a Flask/Streamlit web app for real-time predictions.

Expected Results:
1. Accurate cyclone path prediction compared to actual tracks.
2. Prediction of cyclone intensity (wind speed, pressure).
3. Interactive map visualization showing predicted vs. real cyclone paths.
4. Performance metrics indicating improved accuracy compared to traditional models.

Conclusion :
This project demonstrates the potential of Artificial Intelligence in climate risk management. By leveraging deep learning models such as LSTM and RNN, cyclone paths can be predicted more efficiently and accurately. With real-time integration, the system can serve as a vital tool for governments, disaster response teams, and society in minimizing the devastating impact of cyclones.
